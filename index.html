  <div id="txt_1_1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</div>

  <div id="txt_1_2">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</div>

  <div id="txt_1_1">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.</div>

  <div id ="txt_1_2"> "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</div>

    <div id="txt_5_1">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</div>
  
    <div id ="txt_5_2">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
    100% recommend! ‚Äù</div>
